# Bootstrap Business

## Introduction
A demo business landing page built by leveraging best practises from the HTML5 Boilerplate along with Bootstrap.

This is based on the book [*Bootstrap Site Blueprints*](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/bootstrap-site-blueprints) written by David Cochran, Ian Whitley and published in Feb 2014. 

The general outline was followed, however the latest versions of the HTML5 boilerplate and bootstrap libraries at the time were used.

## Feautures
These are some of the features that have been added to the web page (*not my own words, description used from book*):
*   Styling a complex responsive navbar, so that it appears below the logo and
banner area in medium and large viewports and yet collapses into a mobile-
friendly navbar on smaller screens
*   Building a custom responsive utility navbar, with text and icons that adapt
creatively to suit the needs of larger and smaller screens
*   Designing a responsive layout for the main content of our page, providing an
appropriate visual hierarchy for three tiers of information
*   Building a footer that effectively manages multiple blocks of links and text
across viewports
*   Enhancing our footer with a modified version of the inverted color scheme
we used for the navbar
